# interview-assistant

AI Assistant helping you train for job interviews.


Current functionality: 

1. Upload your name and resume to openai (resume is optional)
2. Assistant starts a mock interview asking you questions about you and your resume/document
3. Conversational flow with assistant

What will (soon) be added:

1. Ability to generate report of interview session
2. Adding of job posting link (will add more information for the assistant)
3. First better text-to-speech, then better speech-to-text (Elevenlabs most likely)
4. Streaming of message instead of polling from open ai
